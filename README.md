# CS135-
or week 0 we are asked to go over programming assignments 53-60 from CSCI 127

53: Hello World!(review.cpp)
    
    Assignment 53 isn't anything crazy it just asks to print out Hello World! and C++ is fun to the console whihc we do using cout. 


54: Nested Loops(nestedForLoops.cpp)

    The nested for loop assignment runs through for loop syntax in C++ and aims for us to print '101010101010' for 10 rows. We easily achieve this by prinitng the string '10' 6 times for 10 rows in a nested loop. The outside loop will serve for the rows and the inside loop will serve to create the string. They key here is end the line outside the nested loop but inside the outer loop.

55: Temperature(temperature.cpp)

    For this program you're really jsut testing your ability to do basic arithmeitc in C++ as well as knowing what variables to declare.

56: EvenSteven(evenNodd.cpp)

    Pretty self explanatory when looking at the assignment. Just testing user input and how to use an if statement. In this case we use an if statment to find if the remainder of i/2 is 0 or not to determine if a number is even and if it is printing it to the console.

57: Classes(classYear.cpp)

    This one isn't too hard just testing your ability to use comparisons and if statements based upon given numbers and strings from the assignment.

58: Shapes(shape.cpp)

    Shapes in retrospect isnt hard especially since theres so little code you just need to make another nested loop but it was weird trying to figure out where to end the line.

59: Annual budget(annualBudget.cpp)

    The annual budget file solves the code that asks you to calculate a budget and see if you would go over or under for the year.
